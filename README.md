## Project Idea : CONTACT BOOK MANAGEMENT

## Problem Statement:
Many individuals struggle with efficiently managing and organizing their contacts. Traditional address books are often disorganized, and finding specific contacts can be time-consuming. There is a need for a user-friendly solution to manage contacts effectively, categorize them, and quickly retrieve information when needed.

## Solution:
Introducing a Contact Book Management CLI application. This application will enable users to maintain a well-organized and easily accessible contact book. With the power of a SQLite database, users can seamlessly add, update, delete, and search for contacts. Additionally, the ability to categorize contacts into groups such as family, friends, and work will enhance the organization of the contact book.

## Minimum Viable Product:
1. Add a New Contact:- Users can add a new contact to the contact book, providing details such as name, phone number, email, and category.
2. List All Contacts:- Display a comprehensive list of all contacts in the contact book, including their key information.
3. Search for a Contact by Keyword:- Allow users to search for a contact using keywords, making it easy to find specific contacts quickly.
4. Update a Contact's Information: - Provide functionality to update the information of an existing contact, ensuring the contact book remains accurate.
5. Delete a Contact: - Enable users to delete a contact from the contact book when it's no longer relevant.
6. Get a Report by Category:- Implement a feature to generate a categorized report, allowing users to view contacts based on their categories (i.e family, friends, work).

The MVP of the Contact Book Management CLI application will include the essential features mentioned above. Users can add, view, search, update, and delete contacts. The ability to generate a categorized report will enhance the organizational aspect of the contact book. The application will be designed for ease of use, focusing on a simple and  command-line interface.
